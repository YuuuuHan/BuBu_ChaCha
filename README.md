Student cab sharing is an ecology unique to the student population, where the most frightening problems for students are poor driver attitudes, dirty cars, violent braking, etc. Therefore, we designed a ride sharing system that matches students and drivers.
## Illustrate
- Student users: Student can create or filter rides according to your ride-share needs (date, time, location, number of people), and filter drivers by reviews and stars.
- Driver side: Drivers can use the system to increase revenue, reduce empty vehicles, anticipate passenger demand, and other benefits.
## Responsible
We are a team of six people, and I am mainly responsible for the interface design and visualization using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
## Outcome
