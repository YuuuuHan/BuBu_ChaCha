Student car-pool is a distinguishing feature of student population, where the most frightening problems for students are poor driver attitudes, dirty cars, violent braking, etc. Therefore, we designed a **ride sharing system that matches students and drivers**.
## Illustrate
- **Student client**: Student can create or filter car-pool group according to your ride-share needs (date, time, location, number of people), and filter drivers by reviews and stars.
- **Driver client**: Drivers can use the system to increase revenue, reduce empty vehicles, anticipate passenger demand, and other benefits.
## Responsible
We are a team of six people, and I am mainly responsible for the **interface design** and **visualization** with **HTML/CSS and Bootstrap**.
## Outcome
- **Front page**:
